# Analysis Tools for the French Parliament

The sources of data for the Assemblee Nationale are confusing.  

I found the simplest method to get the text of speeches is to manually download a file from the official portal that has XML files with the record of every day's business.

There is a python script that works through these XML files to create files for each deputy.
