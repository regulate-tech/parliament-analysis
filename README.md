# Readme for Parliament Analysis

A descriptive guide to the tools for looking at the interests of politicians. For technical requirements please see the SETUP.md file.

## WHO

You engage with politicians in some capacity, either representing an organisation or in your individual capacity.

## WHAT

You are looking for a good analysis of the politicians' interests and some suggestions for how best to engage with them.

## WHY

You have some interest to advance with the politicians and want to make this efficient for you and them by understanding more about their interest in your subject.

## WHERE

These tools can be used in any country where there is publicly available data about politicians and a public record of their speeches.

## WHEN

You can set parameters within the scripts to analyse data for the timeframe that is most relevant for your subject (typically longer for an issue covered less frequently).

## HOW

1. you build a database of politicians for that area using scripts to pull data from public sources.
2. you create a respository of speeches made by relevant politicians from public sources.
3. you ask a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyse the repository of speeches drawing out individual politician interests.
4. you can iterate with the LLM for different types of analysis and advice that would be useful to you.
5. you present the output of the analysis in a format that makes it easy to understand and use.

## WHAT NEXT

The first instance of this code looked at politicians in Sweden.  We can build this out for different countries starting with the UK and each iteration will produce new learning.

We can look at different kinds of analyses which might be rolled into the core product or offered as alternative outputs.
